# This is an auto-generated file - Do not edit it file directly #
# ------------------------------------------------------------- #

# This file is automatically generated by merging two files:
# 1. The Exercism-wide labels
# 2. The repository-specific labels
#
# The Exercism-wide labels are defined in
# https://github.com/exercism/org-wide-files/blob/main/synced-files/.github/labels.yml
#
# The repository-specific labels are defined in `.appends/.github/labels.yml`.
# If you want to change the repository-specific labels, update the
# `.appends/.github/labels.yml` file and _not_ this file.
#
# Any changes to the repo's `.appends/.github/labels.yml` file or the
# Exercism-wide `labels.yml` file will automatically result in this file being
# regenerated and the labels being updated. This typically takes 5-10 minutes.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# These are the Exercism-wide labels which are shared across all repos. #

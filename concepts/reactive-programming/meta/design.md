This in current concept can take in an array of numbers and create 2 dimensional data grid points using
a reactive process.

The exercise requires a student to take in a single array and generate 2D Coordinates
using a reactive process where one variable changing can cause multiple types of different data manipulation 
focused around it.

By doing this I believe it forces the student to conceptualize what a reaction is in terms of programming. 
I included a basic template in the "about.md" file which can be used to solve the concept exercise fairly quickly.

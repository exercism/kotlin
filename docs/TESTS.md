# Windows

1. Open a Command Prompt.
2. Get an exercise:

    ```batchfile
    C:\Users\JohnDoe>exercism download --exercise=hello-world --track=kotlin

    Not Submitted:     1 problem
    Kotlin (Hello World) C:\Users\JohnDoe\exercism\kotlin\hello-world

    New:               1 problem
    Kotlin (Hello World) C:\Users\JohnDoe\exercism\kotlin\hello-world

    unchanged: 0, updated: 0, new: 1
    ```

3. Change directory into the exercism:

    ```batchfile
    C:\Users\JohnDoe>cd C:\Users\JohnDoe\exercism\kotlin\hello-world
    ```

4. Run the tests:

    ```batchfile
    C:\Users\JohnDoe\exercism\kotlin\hello-world>gradlew.bat test
    ```
   *(Don't worry about the tests failing, at first, this is how you begin each exercise.)*

5. Solve the exercise.  Find and work through the `TUTORIAL.md` guide ([view on GitHub](https://github.com/exercism/kotlin/blob/main/exercises/practice/hello-world/TUTORIAL.md)).


Good luck!  Have fun!

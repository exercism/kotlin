# Word Count

Given a phrase, count the occurrences of each word in that phrase.

For example for the input `"olly olly in come free"`

```text
olly: 2
in: 1
come: 1
free: 1
```

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for Kotlin to install the necessary
dependencies:

[https://exercism.io/tracks/kotlin/installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/kotlin/installation)

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ gradlew test
```

> Use `gradlew.bat` if you're on Windows

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by removing the
`@Ignore` annotation.

## Source

This is a classic toy problem, but we were reminded of it by seeing it in the Go Tour.

# Hints

## General

- An [integer (`Int`) value][numbers] can be defined as one or more consecutive digits.
- Use variables to give nice and readable names for your values. Remember that code readability is much more important than amount of code lines.

## 1. Calculate remaining baking time in minutes

- You need to define a [function][functions] with a single parameter.
- You need to assign a [default value][function-defaults] for the parameter.
- You have to explicitly return an integer value from a method.
- The method's parameter is an [integer][numbers].
- You need to use the mathematical operator for subtraction (`-`) to subtract values.

## 2. Calculate the preparation time in minutes

- You need to define a [function][functions] with a single parameter.
- You have to explicitly return an integer value from a method.
- The method's parameter is an [integer][numbers].
- You need to use the mathematical operator for addition (`+`) to add values.

## 3. Calculate the elapsed time in minutes

- You need to define a [function][functions] with a two parameters.
- You need to assign a [default value][function-defaults] for the second parameter.
- You have to explicitly return an integer value from a method.
- The method's parameter is an [integer][numbers].
- You need to use the mathematical operator for addition (`+`) to add values.
- You need to call already implemented functions.

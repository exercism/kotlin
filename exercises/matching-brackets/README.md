# Matching Brackets

Given a string containing brackets `[]`, braces `{}`, parentheses `()`,
or any combination thereof, verify that any and all pairs are matched
and nested correctly.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for Kotlin to install the necessary
dependencies:

[https://exercism.io/tracks/kotlin/installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/kotlin/installation)

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ gradlew test
```

> Use `gradlew.bat` if you're on Windows

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by removing the
`@Ignore` annotation.
